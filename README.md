# DHCS_Medical_Providers_Database-and-WebApp
This project provides an example of how one can build an RShiny app that processes data stored in your local MySQL database instance(localhost) and acts as a service locator app one can use to find where they can avail a particular service near their current location. This project uses various datasets provided by the DHCS(https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset) portal to create a database with various tables modeled in 3NF form and insert sample records for each of them. This project is only intended to show other avenues the DHCS can consider to set up their data platforms and create reports on top of that and demonstrates the service location functionality with the FFS providers data to allow one to find which FFS(fee for service) medical providers that are enrolled in the Medi-Cal program are nearby one's current location.
